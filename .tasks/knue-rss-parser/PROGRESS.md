# Progress Log: KNUE RSS Parser

## 2025-10-19

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Memory bank refresh**
   - Reconciled `.agents/`, `.tasks/`, `.spec/` with current implementation (html-to-text + preview service).
   - Added metadata/front-matter to templates and archive guidelines.
   - Condensed task backlog and RSP artifacts for quicker onboarding.

2. **Spec alignment**
   - Updated canonical spec to v1.2.0 (preview enrichment + two-year retention, html-to-text dependency, env vars).
   - Synced SPEC-DELTA with passing test counts and coverage guard rails.

3. **Retention window enforcement**
   - Added two-year cutoff for ingestion and R2 cleanup (AC-8).
   - Extended integration coverage for skip + delete workflows.
   - Promoted spec to v1.2.0 and refreshed SPEC-DELTA tracking.

### üìã Next Steps
1. Monitor preview API stability before proposing retry enhancements.
2. Schedule ESLint 9 migration (TASK-002) once Cloudflare releases flat-config guidance for Workers.

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyzed actual KNUE RSS feed structure
   - Identified CDATA usage, HTML content, custom fields
   - Discovered numbered attachment pattern (filename1-N, url1-N, preview1-N)
   - Updated RESEARCH.md with findings

2. **Specification Phase**
   - Updated SPEC-DELTA.md with actual RSS structure:
     - AC-3: Added CDATA, department, dynamic attachments
     - AC-4: Added HTML‚ÜíMarkdown conversion, attachments section
     - Dependencies: Added `turndown` for HTML conversion
     - Examples: Updated with actual KNUE RSS format
   - Resolved open items:
     - ‚úÖ RSS feed URL confirmed
     - ‚úÖ Storage strategy decided (YYYY/MM/DD.md)

3. **Planning Phase**
   - Updated PLAN.md with:
     - Correct RSS feed URL
     - Added `turndown` dependency
     - Split Markdown converter into two steps (HTML converter + full converter)
     - Updated data structures (RSSItem, RSSAttachment)
     - Enhanced test cases for attachments and CDATA

### üìã Next Steps
Ready to start implementation:
1. Initialize Wrangler project
2. Set up project structure
3. Begin TDD implementation starting with RSS fetcher

### üìù Notes
- RSS uses CDATA extensively - parser must handle this
- Attachments use numbered pattern - need dynamic parsing
- HTML description requires conversion to Markdown for readability
- Date format is YYYY-MM-DD with no timezone (assume KST)
- 2025-10-18 update: switched Markdown conversion dependency from `turndown` to `html-to-text` for Workers compatibility.
