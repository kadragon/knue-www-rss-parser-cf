# Branch Policy â€” ðŸš« No Work on Main

## Rule

**Never commit or push directly to `main`.**

## Branch Naming Convention

Use feature branches with the following prefixes:

- `feat/<task>` â€” New features
- `fix/<issue>` â€” Bug fixes
- `docs/<topic>` â€” Documentation updates
- `refactor/<scope>` â€” Code restructuring
- `chore/<task>` â€” Maintenance tasks
- `test/<scope>` â€” Test additions/modifications

## Workflow

1. Create branch from `main`
2. Work on feature branch
3. Commit only on Green (all tests pass)
4. Create PR when ready
5. Merge only after review & CI passes

## Enforcement

All commits must be from feature branches.  
Direct pushes to `main` are prohibited.
