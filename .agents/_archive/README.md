# Archive Folder Guide

- Park deprecated or superseded policies here for audit purposes only.
- Structure hierarchy as `.agents/_archive/<year>/Q<quarter>/file.md`.
- Ensure each archived file has `status: deprecated` and links to its successor.
- Do not delete archived content without explicit approval.
